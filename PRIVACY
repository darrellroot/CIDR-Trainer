The authors of CIDR-Trainer do not want your private information and do not collect your private information via CIDR Trainer

CIDR Trainer only makes network connections for the following purposes:

CIDR Trainer uses Apple iCloud/Core Data APIs to sync your progress in the app between your devices. This may include background
updates via Apple push notification infrastructure.

CIDR Trainer uses Apple in-app-purchasing APIs to unlock full functionality. This requires periodic network connections to
Apple infrastructure.

CIDR Trainer may ask if you want to review the app. If you agree, your review would use the network to connect to Apple.

A future version of CIDR Trainer may use Apple Game Center APIs to enable "achievements" and "leaderboards" as you progress
through the app. This would only be enabled if you choose to sign into Game Center. The leaderboards would show your Game Center alias.

CIDR trainer does not include any 3rd-party advertisement or metric APIs. The only app usage metrics are collected by Apple
(see Settings->Privacy->Share iPad Analytics). An anonymized statistical summary of aggregate app usage is shared with the authors
via Apple App Store Infrastructure.
